## WHEN VERTICAL SPACING IS USED:

### Digital-First Content:
- Blog posts converted to ebooks
- Self-published books without professional design
- Business manuals/reports
- Technical documentation

### Specific Exceptions:
- Children's books (large type, lots of white space)
- Poetry collections (different rules)
- Graphic design books (intentional artistic choice)
- Some academic textbooks (for note-taking)

## PROFESSIONAL PUBLISHER STANDARDS (2025):

### Major Publishers (Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster):
- 98% use INDENTED paragraphs for narrative non-fiction
- 2% exceptions for experimental/artistic works

### Why Indent Remains Standard:

1. **Print Legacy** - 500+ years of typographic tradition
2. **Eye Movement** - Easier to track on physical pages
3. **Space Efficiency** - More content per page = lower costs
4. **Reader Expectation** - Professionals expect traditional layout
5. **Credibility Signal** - Indent = professionally published

### Why Vertical Spacing Feels "Modern":

- **Web influence** - We read online with vertical spacing
- **Screen readability** - Monitors need more breathing room
- **Digital-first** - Blogs, articles, websites all use parskip
- **Informal feel** - More casual, less authoritative

## HYBRID APPROACHES (2020s Trend):

Some modern publishers use:
- **Smaller indent (1em instead of 1.5em)** - Subtle but present
- **First paragraph no indent** - Only after section breaks
- **Increased line spacing** - 1.15-1.25 instead of 1.0
- **Generous margins** - More white space at edges
- **BUT STILL INDENT** - Between paragraphs

## THE VERDICT FOR YOUR BOOK:

Genre: Spiritual wisdom / Self-help
Audience: Seekers, professionals, serious readers
Comparable titles: Gītā commentaries, Tolle, Singer, Chödrön

### Recommended: INDENTED (Current Choice)
Why:
✓ Your audience expects traditional book formatting
✓ Spiritual/philosophical genre uses indent
✓ Professional credibility important for religious text
✓ Competing books all use indent
✓ Print-first design (not digital-first)

### NOT Recommended: Vertical Spacing
Why:
✗ Signals "self-published without designer"
✗ Wastes paper (environmental concern)
✗ Increases price point

"Modern" in book design (2025) means:
✓ Clean sans-serif chapter headings
