Dear friend,

I need to tell you something I've never said out loud. Something about the way certain eyes pass over you in the temple hallway. The way conversations pause when you approach. The way your raised hand gets ignored in question-and-answer sessions while others' insights are celebrated.

I see you because I've been you.

## Before I Understood

I remember the first time I felt it. Not the obvious kind that makes headlines, but the subtle kind that lives in glances and silences. I was sitting in the third row during Bhagavatam class, notebook ready, heart open. The speaker asked a question about surrender. My hand shot up immediately—I'd been wrestling with this exact verse all week during my morning study.

His eyes swept the room. Past me. Around me. Through me. He called on Govinda Prabhu in the back, whose answer was nearly identical to what I'd prepared to say. The room nodded appreciatively. I lowered my hand and stared at my notebook, pretending the slight didn't register.

But it did. It always does.

Maybe for you it's your accent that marks you as "other." Your skin color that somehow suggests less spiritual depth. Your gender that implies limited understanding. Your economic status that whispers "not quite devotee material." Your age that screams either "too young to know" or "too old to change."

The particular category doesn't matter. What matters is that moment when you realize you're being measured by something other than your devotion.

## During the Slow Recognition

It took months to name what was happening. The pattern was too consistent to ignore, too subtle to confront directly.

**The Invisible Contributor:** Your service gets overlooked while identical efforts by others receive praise. You clean the same altar flowers, but Madhavi gets thanked publicly. You research the same philosophical points, but Krishnananda's insights get quoted in the next class. You pour the same love into your offerings, but somehow yours register as less significant.

**The Perpetual Outsider:** Conversations shift when you join them. Not hostile—that would be easier to address. Just... different. Less animated. More careful. As if your presence requires some kind of translation or accommodation that nobody wants to make.

**The Questioned Devotee:** Your spiritual experiences get scrutinized while others' get celebrated. Your realizations require more proof. Your dedication needs more demonstration. Your commitment faces more testing. Not because of your actions, but because of who you are when you perform them.

I started keeping a mental tally. How many times my questions went unanswered. How often my service contributions got attributed to others. How frequently I felt like I was watching community life through glass instead of living it.

The worst part wasn't the exclusion. It was the gaslighting of my own perception. "You're being too sensitive." "That's not what they meant." "You're looking for problems that aren't there."

But problems that aren't acknowledged can't be solved. And I was drowning in something I wasn't allowed to name.

## After the Breaking Point

The breaking point came during a festival I'd helped organize. I'd spent weeks coordinating the prasadam distribution, managing vendors, solving logistical problems that would have derailed the entire event. Everything went smoothly. Perfectly, actually.

During the appreciation announcements, they thanked everyone but me. Not an oversight—a pattern. I watched from the back as others received garlands for contributions that wouldn't have been possible without the foundation I'd built.

I left early. Sat in my car in the parking lot and finally admitted what I'd been avoiding for months: This wasn't about spiritual advancement or devotional qualification. This was about discrimination, plain and simple. And it was happening in a community supposedly dedicated to seeing the soul beyond the body.

That night I opened my Bhagavad-gita, desperate for some kind of guidance. Some reassurance that my experience mattered, that my devotion counted, that Krishna saw what others missed.

**Bhagavad-gita 9.29** stared back at me: "I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him."

Equal to all. Not equal except for certain categories. Not equal with different standards. Equal to all.

## What I Learned About Divine Vision

Krishna's vision operates by completely different principles than human discrimination. While people see external designations, Krishna sees the heart's intention. While communities create hierarchies, Krishna recognizes only the hierarchy of devotion.

**Bhagavad-gita 4.11** became my anchor: "As all surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pritha."

Everyone. Not everyone who fits a particular profile. Not everyone who speaks the right way or looks the right way or comes from the right background. Everyone who surrenders.

This verse demolished every justification I'd heard for spiritual discrimination. If Krishna accepts all sincere souls equally, what authority does anyone else have to establish different standards?

**Bhagavad-gita 18.55** went further: "One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."

Understanding comes through devotional service, not through social credentials. Access to transcendence depends on surrender, not on external qualifications. The kingdom of God opens to devotion, not to demographic categories.

But here's what took longer to understand: The discrimination you face isn't a commentary on your spiritual worth. It's a revelation of others' spiritual poverty.

## What I Discovered About Strength

Discrimination in spiritual communities creates a particular kind of spiritual strength. When your devotion can't rely on social validation, it becomes more authentic. When your service can't depend on recognition, it becomes more selfless. When your relationship with Krishna can't be mediated by others' approval, it becomes more direct.

**Bhagavad-gita 2.47** took on new meaning: "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but never to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty."

Your duty isn't to gain acceptance from those who discriminate. Your duty is to serve Krishna regardless of who notices or approves. The fruits of recognition, validation, and community status aren't guaranteed and shouldn't be the motivation.

This doesn't mean accepting discrimination passively. It means finding power in devotion that no one can diminish.

I started approaching service differently. Instead of seeking acknowledgment from the community, I offered everything directly to Krishna. Instead of waiting for invitations to participate, I created my own avenues of service. Instead of requiring others to see my worth, I anchored my identity in Krishna's equal vision.

Something unexpected happened. My devotion became more powerful, not less. When you remove the intermediary of others' approval, your connection to Krishna intensifies.

## What I Hope For You

If you're reading this with recognition, if you're nodding at experiences I've described, I want you to know something: Your devotion matters exactly as much as anyone else's. Your service counts equally in Krishna's ledger. Your spiritual potential isn't limited by others' prejudices.

But I also want you to be strategic. Don't let discrimination derail your spiritual progress. Don't internalize others' limitations as your own. Don't mistake community politics for spiritual truth.

**Bhagavad-gita 7.18** offers perspective: "All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he is sure to attain Me, the highest and most perfect goal."

Krishna considers sincere devotees "just like My own self." Not conditionally. Not with asterisks. Not with demographic qualifications. The devotee engaged in transcendental service receives the highest recognition possible—Krishna's own identification.

This means your value isn't up for debate. It's established. Your worth isn't contingent on others' recognition. It's inherent. Your spiritual future isn't limited by present discrimination. It's guaranteed by devotional service.

Continue serving. Continue chanting. Continue studying. Continue growing. Let your devotion speak louder than others' prejudices. Let your character shine brighter than their limitations. Let your spiritual advancement demonstrate what they're too blind to see.

And remember: Every slight you transcend makes you stronger. Every barrier you overcome makes you wiser. Every prejudice you rise above brings you closer to Krishna's equal vision.

The temple may have hierarchies, but Krishna's heart doesn't. The community may have blind spots, but Krishna's vision is perfect. Others may discriminate, but Krishna never does.

Your friend in service,
Light of Dharma

P.S. Don't let them make you smaller. Krishna has bigger plans for your devotion than they can imagine.
