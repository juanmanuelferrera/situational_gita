# Self Esteem

## The Scoreboard

Priya keeps a mental scoreboard.

Not consciously. Not deliberately. But it's there, running constantly in the background of every interaction, every achievement, every failure.

*Good presentation at the quarterly review: +10 points*  
*Forgot to reply to client email for three days: -15 points*  
*Complimented by manager: +20 points*  
*Overheard colleague saying she "doesn't get it": -30 points*

The scoreboard determines everything — how she feels about herself, whether she deserves to take up space in a room, whether she's allowed to speak up in meetings, whether she's worthy of love, respect, belonging.

Right now, sitting at her desk at 7:15 PM — the office mostly empty, the cleaners making their rounds — the scoreboard reads low.

Very low.

She missed a deadline today. Not by much — just a few hours, and the client didn’t even seem to mind. But Priya minds. Because the scoreboard doesn’t grade on curves or consider context. It’s absolute. Binary. Success or failure. Worthy or worthless.

And tonight, she’s worthless.

Her phone buzzes. Her sister asks if she wants to grab dinner. Priya stares at the text. *No,* she thinks. *I don’t deserve dinner. I don’t deserve to enjoy anything. Not until I’ve earned it back.*

She declines. Says she’s busy. Returns to her screen — to the work that might restore a few points, might lift her just high enough to feel human again.

This is how she's lived for thirty-four years.

And she's exhausted.

## Your Worth Isn’t Conditional

Most of us carry a version of Priya’s scoreboard.

We learned it young — from parents who praised us when we succeeded and withdrew when we failed. From teachers who measured our worth in grades. From a culture that tells us we're only as valuable as our productivity, beauty, achievements, and usefulness.

The equation is simple:

*Worth = Performance*

Do well → feel good about yourself.  
Do poorly → feel shame, inadequacy, worthlessness.

It sounds logical — like how the world works. But here’s the lie hidden in that equation:

*You are not your performance.*

Your essential self — the consciousness, the soul, the eternal witness — doesn’t get more valuable when you succeed or less valuable when you fail. It doesn’t accumulate worth through achievements or lose it through mistakes.

It simply *is.* Eternally. Completely. Independent of anything temporary.

But we’ve forgotten this. We’ve confused our *roles* with our *selves*. We think we are what we do, what we achieve, what others think of us. And so our sense of worth becomes conditional — fragile, subject to constant evaluation.

The result? Exhaustion. Anxiety. Endless striving that never arrives at lasting peace.

The Bhagavad-gītā offers a radical alternative:  
Worth based not on performance — but on *being.*

## The Gītā Speaks: The Unchanging Self

Kṛṣṇa speaks to Arjuna at a moment when Arjuna’s self-worth has collapsed.

Arjuna sees himself as a failure — a warrior who can’t fight, a prince who’s lost his composure, a man about to abandon his duty. By every measure he’s worthless in this moment.

But Kṛṣṇa doesn’t measure Arjuna that way.

He points instead to what Arjuna truly is, beneath all the roles and fluctuations:

> “The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.”  
> *Bhagavad-gītā 2.23*

Your essential self is indestructible — not metaphorically, but literally.

The body can be harmed. The mind can be disturbed. Roles can be lost. Achievements can crumble.

But *you*, the conscious self, cannot be touched by any of it.

> “This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.”  
> *Bhagavad-gītā 2.24*

**Everlasting.** Not dependent on time.  
**Present everywhere.** Not limited to role or identity.  
**Unchangeable.** Not subject to the scoreboard.  
**Eternally the same.** Failure doesn’t diminish it; success doesn’t inflate it.

This is the foundation of unconditional worth.

You don’t *earn* value by performing well. You don’t *lose* it by performing poorly. Your value is inherent, eternal, absolute — because it comes from what you *are*, not what you *do*.

Does this mean actions don’t matter? No.  
It means your *worth* isn’t on the line when you act.

The scoreboard measures your *actions.*  
But you are not your actions.  
You are the eternal self — witnessing, learning, evolving, but never defined by outcomes.

## Living the Teaching: Separating Self from Performance

Priya sits in her therapist’s office three weeks later.

She’s been practicing something new — separating the scoreboard from her self.

It started small. After missing a deadline, instead of spiraling into self-loathing, she looked clearly:

- *The deadline was missed.* → Fact.  
- *The client needs the work by tomorrow.* → Consequence.  
- *I need to complete it and learn from this.* → Response.  

Then she added:  
*None of this changes my worth as a person.*

Her therapist nods. “And how did that feel?”

Priya pauses. “Weird. Like I was letting myself off the hook too easily.”

“Were you?”

“No. I still did the work and fixed the problem. But I didn’t punish myself. I didn’t feel like I had to earn back my right to exist.”

That’s the shift — taking responsibility *without shame.*

To recognize:  
You can fail and still be worthy.  
You can succeed and not become more worthy.  
You are already okay — before, during, and after any action.  
Because you are the eternal, unchangeable, indestructible self.

### The Practice of Unconditional Worth

1. **Notice when the scoreboard activates.** Observe when you feel more or less worthy — after praise, criticism, success, or failure.  
2. **Separate the action from the self.** Say it explicitly: “I made a mistake” vs. “I am a mistake.”  
3. **Remember the Gītā’s teaching.** Your self is “everlasting, unchangeable, eternally the same.”  
4. **Respond from worth, not for worth.** Act rightly, not to earn value. You already have it.  
5. **Practice self-compassion.** Be kind when you fail. Learn, but don’t condemn yourself.

Each time you separate the scoreboard from your self, you loosen its grip — and remember what you really are.

## The Way Forward: Living Unscored

Six months later, Priya makes another mistake at work — bigger this time.  
She gives a presentation with wrong data and gets corrected in front of everyone.

The old scoreboard screams: *-100 points. Worthless.*

But something’s different.

She feels the shame — acknowledges it — but beneath it, something steady remains:  
*I made an error. I’ll correct it. But I’m still valuable.*

Afterward, she apologizes, fixes it, and continues her day.  
No collapse. No self-punishment.

She goes to lunch with her sister — not because she “earned” it, but because she’s *allowed* to enjoy life, regardless of the scoreboard.

The scoreboard still exists — but it’s not *her* anymore.  
She is what she’s always been: the eternal, unchangeable, infinitely valuable self.

And that can never be scored.

## Reflection

- What’s on your scoreboard?  
- What makes you feel more or less worthy?  
- Can you recall a situation where you confused action with self?  
- What would change if you believed your worth was unconditional?
